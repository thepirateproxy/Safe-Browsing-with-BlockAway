# Safe-Browsing-with-BlockAway

**BlockAway** is a free web proxy service designed to route your internet traffic through its servers, allowing you to bypass geo-restrictions and mask your real IP address. This tool requires no downloads, installations, or configurations.

## Is BlockAway Safe to Use?

While BlockAway aims to provide secure and private browsing, there are several considerations to keep in mind for a safe experience:

1. **Privacy Policy and Terms of Service:** Always review these documents to understand how your data is managed. Be cautious if the service logs your browsing activity.
2. **Advertisements:** Excessive ads can be a red flag as they may contain malware or redirect you to malicious websites.
3. **Sensitive Information:** Avoid entering sensitive data like passwords, credit card details, or personal information. Free web proxies may not offer robust security measures.
4. **Premium Proxy Services:** For enhanced security and privacy, consider using a reputable premium proxy service. OkeyProxy, for example, offers comprehensive protection and encryption.

## How to Use BlockAway Proxy

To utilize BlockAway, follow these steps:

1. **Verify Original IP:** Before starting, you can check your original IP address at [ipinfo.io](https://ipinfo.io). For instance, it might show as 69.178.2.126 from Alaska, USA.
2. **Visit BlockAway:** Open your web browser and go to [BlockAway](https://www.blockaway.net/).
3. **Enter URL:** Input the desired website URL and click the “Go” button.
4. **Confirm IP Change:** On the result page, you can use ipinfo to confirm that your IP address has been altered.
5. **Disconnect:** Once done, close the browser tab or window to disconnect from the proxy service.
